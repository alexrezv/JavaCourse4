 * Assignment 4: Finding the Closest Earthquakes to a Location
 * In this assignment you will complete the program to determine the N closests earthquakes to a specified location that

 * Specifically, for this assignment, you will only modify the ClosestQuakes class

    * The first method you need has already been written for you. The method findClosestQuakes reads in data on
    * earthquakes storing them in the ArrayList list and prints how many quakes there are. It sets a location variable
    * named jakarta to the location of the city Jakarta. It then calls the method getClosest to determine the ten
    * closest earthquakes in list and prints information about those quakes and how close they are to Jakarta.
    * This method has already been written for you, but doesnâ€™t work yet since the method getClosest is not complete.
    *
    * Complete the method getClosest that has already been started for you. This method has three parameters,
    * an ArrayList of type QuakeEntry named quakeData, a Location named current, and an int named howMany.
    * This method should find the closest number of howMany earthquakes to the current Location and return them in
    * an ArrayList of type QuakeEntry. The earthquakes should be in the ArrayList in order with the closest earthquake
    * in index position 0. If there are fewer then howMany earthquakes in quakeData, then the ArrayList returned would
    * be the same size as quakeData.
